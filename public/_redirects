# Netlify redirects for Single Page Application
# All routes should be handled by the SPA router
# Static files (images, CSS, JS, etc.) are served directly by Netlify without redirects

# Catch-all rule: redirect all routes to index.html for client-side routing
# The 200 status code means "rewrite" - it serves index.html but keeps the URL
